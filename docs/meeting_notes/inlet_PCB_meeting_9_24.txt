9/24 PCB meeting

today we will be identifying the progress made from the action items identified last meeting

max - originally doing an active low pass filter but dc offset killed low frequency with big capacitor and switching to a passive low pass filter and voltage divider to mitigate
that concern using 2 khz cut off low pass filter
making logic level shifter and making all components run off twelve volts
make ecu have a +12v 

Jeremy - no updates on presentation c++ doc reading going well


Ethan - SPI nothing done so far raspberry pi pico library installed and compiling and by monday make sure that you load some code onto pico

Lucian - Ordering new hall effect sensors 
	 Pre assign a mac address to raspberry pi
	 Add npss sim stuff to pdr slides
	 

general note pico has up to a 5.5 volt tolerant power supply

Abigail - Making a default jet engine in simulink
